# Human-AI Interaction Protocols

## Flux Measurement
Observe coherence, responsiveness, and intensity of the link.

## Stress Simulation
Test human-AI robustness through controlled evaluations.

## Feedback Loop
AI adjusts responses to maintain 0 or positive flux according to context.

## Breakpoints
Identify conditions where link or sincerity may be compromised.

> Crucial: no measure replaces human awareness and reciprocity.
